      Joining ComSSA
    </h2>
    To get the most out of ComSSA, you’ll want to become an official member. You’ll receive a membership sticker to place on
    your Curtin ID card, which will entitle you to a range of discounts with our sponsors, access to our services, as well as
    special member pricing for our events. You can become a member of ComSSA for $5 if you’re a Curtin Guild Member or for free
    with a Curtin Student Guild club membership voucher. Interested in joining? You can join in one of two ways: <br><br>
    Note: If you’re using a club membership voucher then you must follow the In-Person method.

    Talk to a committee member around building 314 at Curtin and we’ll be happy to sign you up. You can often find us hanging
    out in the Comssa Common Room, Room 345 Level 3 Building 314. If you’re not sure who we are,

    the committee posters on one of the notice boards in 314. Can’t find a committee member? Contact a committee member through
    discord and setup a time.

    If you’d prefer to sign up online, that’s even easier! Unfortunately, you can’t use club membership vouchers to sign up online.

    To get started, head over <a href="https://comssamemberships.getqpay.com/">here</a>.
    You’ll be asked for your Curtin Student Guild membership status, so please use this to let us know if you are a Guild member.
    Please do not mark yourself as paying with a voucher — this will not lessen any online membership fees.
