        <p>
          ComSSA is the club that supports computing, computer
          engineering, and networking students at Curtin University.
          <br><br>

          We also support non-computing students by providing events
          and services that give like minded individuals (anyone
          interested in programming or computing) a space to find
          support, socialise and communicate.<br><br>

          You do not need to be a computing student. Membership is
          open to everyone, even if youâ€™re not a student! <br><br>

          Committee members can be found throughout the level 2 labs
          in building 314 or in the ComSSA common room (314.345).
          <NuxtLink to="/about">
            Not sure who we are?
          </NuxtLink>
          <br><br>

          ComSSA provides a wide
          <NuxtLink to="/events">
            range of events
          </NuxtLink>
          and services for its members, such as academic assistance,
          social events and industry orientated events. <br><br>

          ComSSA is affiliated with Curtin Student Guild which means
          if you are a Curtin student and have a voucher from the
          guild diary then membership is free.
