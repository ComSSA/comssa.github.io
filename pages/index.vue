        <h2>Who are we?</h2>

        <p>
          ComSSA is the club that supports computing, computer engineering, and networking
          students at Curtin University. <br><br>

          We also support non-computing students by providing events and services that give
          like minded individuals (anyone interested in programming or computing) a space to find support,
          socialise and communicate.<br><br>

          You do not need to be a computing student. Membership is open to everyone, even if
          youâ€™re not a student! <br><br>

          Committee members can be found throughout the level 2 labs in building 314 or in the
          ComSSA common room (314.345). <NuxtLink to="/about">
            Not sure who we are?
          </NuxtLink> <br><br>

          ComSSA provides a wide <NuxtLink to="/events">
            range of events
          </NuxtLink> and services for its members, such as academic
          assistance, social events and industry orientated events. <br><br>

          ComSSA is affiliated with Curtin Student Guild which means if you are a Curtin student
          and have a voucher from the guild diary then membership is free.
