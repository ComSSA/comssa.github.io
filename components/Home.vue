                <p>
                    ComSSA is the club that supports computing, computer engineering, and networking
                    students at Curtin University. <br/><br/>

                    Most of the time, committee members can be found within the 314 level 2 labs.<br/><br/>

                    We provide a wide range of events and services for our members, such as academic
                    assistance, social events, industry presentations, and free Microsoft software
                    licences!<br><br/>

                    Membership is open to everyone, even if youâ€™re not a student! <br/><br/>

                    Being affiliated with the Curtin Student Guild also means that membership is
                    free, if you have a voucher from the Guild diary.
